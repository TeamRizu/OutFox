        # **Logs and Additional Content**
        #1. Go into the game folder
        #2. Open the Logs folder
        #3. Grab every file in there and post with the issue.
        #4. Go back to the game folder, if there's an crashinfo.txt then send it too.

        If you happen to play on Non-Portable mode, [check the location of your Contents folder](https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/config/folders/) to find it, and proceed with step #2.
